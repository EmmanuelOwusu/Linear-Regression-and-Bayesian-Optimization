# Linear-Regression-and-Bayesian-Optimization

This Repository contains course work done at African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) with Prof Marc Deisenroth.

* Linear Regression
  
  * Maximum Likelihood Estimation : is a method of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a likelihood function
  
  * Maximum A Posteriori Estimation : is an estimate of an unknown quantity, that equals the mode of the posterior distribution.
  
  
 * Bayesian Optimization
 
 The goal of the Bayessian Optimization file  is to illustrate how to use Gaussian processes for Global optimization.

 We  focused on two aspects of Bayesian Optimization (BO):
 
     * Choice of the model
    
     * Acquisition function.
