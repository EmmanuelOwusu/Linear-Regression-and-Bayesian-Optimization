# Linear-Regression-and-Bayesian-Optimization

This Repository contains course work done at African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) with Prof Marc Deisenroth.

* Linear Regression
  
  * Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  
  * Maximum A Posteriori Estimation
  
  
 * Bayesian Optimization
 
 The goal of the Bayessian Optimization file  is to illustrate how to use Gaussian processes for Global optimization.

 We  focused on two aspects of Bayesian Optimization (BO):
 
    * 1. Choice of the model
    
    * 2. Acquisition function.
