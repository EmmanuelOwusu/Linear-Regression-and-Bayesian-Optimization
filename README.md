# Linear-Regression-and-Bayesian-Optimization

This Repository contains course work done at African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) with Prof Marc Deisenroth.

* Linear Regression
  
  * Maximum Likelihood Estimation : 
   It is a method of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a likelihood function
  
  * Maximum A Posteriori Estimation : 
   It is an estimate of an unknown quantity, that equals the mode of the posterior distribution.
  
  
 * Bayesian Optimization
 
 The goal of the Bayessian Optimization file  is to illustrate how to use Gaussian processes for Global optimization.

 We  focused on two aspects of Bayesian Optimization (BO):
 
     1. Choice of the model
    
     2. Acquisition function.
     
     
 * We then define a GP prior

     * We use GPy package as it has GP training and prediction available for us.
     
     * We define a simple GP with Square Exponential Kernel
